During a flooding event, the ability of the terrain to dissipate water flow energy depends on its land-cover type and the associated surface roughness. I developed a new algorithm to map the land-cover changes in the Greater Houston area using repeat-pass polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The algorithm can provide more frequent and accurate surface roughness update in the Advanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) storm surge model framework.
