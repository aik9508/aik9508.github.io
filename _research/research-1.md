Supercooled water cloud, freezing frog and freezing rain interaction with cold surfaces can cause severe hazards for the daily life and many industrial processes, for example attaching and destructing the power cables, increasing the weight and changing the streamlines of the aircrafts, ships and the wind turbines, reducing the friction of cars on roads. We used Computational Fluild Dynamics (CFD) simulation to understand the nucleation of icing through numerical simulations.
