High-altitude mountain glaciers are highly responsive to environmental changes. However, their remote locations limit the applicability of traditional mapping methods, such as probing and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), in tracking changes in ice thickness and glacier volume. Over the past two decades, airborne Tomographic Synthetic Aperture Radar (TomoSAR) has shown promise for mapping the internal structures of mountain glaciers. Yet, its 3D mapping capabilities are limited by the radar signal's relatively shallow penetration depth, with bedrock echoes rarely detected beyond 60 meters. Additionally, most TomoSAR studies ignored the air-ice refraction during the image-focusing step, reducing the 3D focusing accuracy for deeper subsurface targets. To advance the application of SAR technqiues in glacier studies, we developed a new 3-D SAR focusing algorithm for ice thickness estimation. For the first time, we were able to derive the meter-level-resolution of ice thickness distribution entire mountain glaciers, reaching a maximum depth greater than 200 m. The ice thickness maps of five mountain glaciers in northwest China are shown below.
