Coastal subsidence increases future flood risks by damaging infrastructures (e.g., sea walls and levees) and causing a loss of natural barriers that can protect coastal communities from storm surges (e.g., coastal wetlands). This work aims to quantify the land subsidence rate along the Texas and Louisiana coasts using InSAR data. In particular, we focus on improving the subsidence mapping capability over densely vegetated terrains, which is traditionally challenging for InSAR analysis due to the low signal-to-noise ratio.
