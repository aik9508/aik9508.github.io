I received the Ph.D. degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2023, the M.S. degree in engineering from Ã‰cole Polytechnique in 2018, and the B.S. degree in physics from Nanjing University in 2015. I worked as a research associate at Suzhou Aerospace Information Reserach Institute from October 2023 to January 2025. I am a recipient of NASA's FINESST Grant. My research interests include Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Tomographic Synthetic Aperture Radar (TomoSAR) techniques. My research is motivated by challenging geophysical problems that have significant environmental and societal impacts and usually cross disciplinary boundaries.
